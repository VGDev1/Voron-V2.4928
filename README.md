# Klipper and SuperSlicer profiles for Voron V2.4928

![Printer](img.png)

This is the configs of my Voron 2.4 300 mm3 Serial:V2.4928

Be aware I see my config as WIP and it can and will change any time. I normally do only checkin stuff that is tested and run with the base klipper branch but I test also klipper PRs so it can happen that I oversee that from time to time and have stuff here that needs a special PR from klipper.

## My Setup

* LDO 300 mm Voron 2.4 kit
* Klicky 
* Stealthburner CW2
* Oseq Safe Sheet
* Genuine Gates brand pulleys/idlers in gantry
* Rapido HF
* Bondtech CHT 0.4 nozzle
* Pi cam
* Nozzle brush
* Bed fan mod
* GE5C mod using EGLM-05 - IGUBAL
